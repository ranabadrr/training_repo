# Comparison between implementing model from Scratch and Using built-in Models


## **Ease of Use:**  The TensorFlow version is much easier to implement. With only a few lines of code, we can build, compile, and train a complex neural network. TensorFlow abstracts away many low-level details, making it user-friendly, while building from scratch gives more control but is more challenging and requires a lot of code and detailed knowledge of gradient computation, matrix operations, and numerical stability issues

## **Performance:** TensorFlow is highly optimized for performance and can leverage GPU/TPU hardware acceleration. The built-in layers, optimizers, and loss functions are well-optimized, leading to faster training times while building from scratch is slower, especially for larger datasets and complex models

## **Flexibility:** Keras/TensorFlow offers more flexibility for rapid experimentation with different layers, optimizers, and loss functions.  while from-scratch code is better suited for learning and small experiments.
