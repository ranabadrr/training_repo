## Tasks

### Task 1: [C++ Problem Solving Problems]
- `session1_1.cpp` - a program that reads a name from the input and prints a greeting message in the format: "Hello, [name]!".
- `session1_2.cpp` - a program to print a pyramid pattern of a specified height using asterisks (*).
- `session1_3.cpp` - a program to search for a specific value in an array of integers and return its index if found. If the value is not present, the program should return -1.
- `session1_4.cpp` - a program that takes a list of integers representing heights achieved during flight training and returns the maximum height recorded.
- `session1_5.cpp` - a program to determine which team, either the Justice League or the villains, wins in the majority of corresponding cells based on their power levels.

### Task 2: [Proteus Projects]
- `Hbridge.pdsprj` - Hbridge driver circuit to control the direction of DC motor
- `Rectifier.pdsprj` - Rectification circuit of 220V AC as an input and 5V DC output
---

### Task 3: [TinkerCAD Projects]
- `Tinkercad_links.txt` - Tinkercad projects for arduino connected to different sensors
---

### Task 4: [Machine Learning ]
- `problem1.ipynb` - Data preprocessing for `Weather Dataset.csv'` data set
- `problem3.ipynb` - Temperature Detection using different Regression models on `weatherHistory.csv` data set
- `Bounus.ipynb` - Segmantation of mall Customers from `Mall_Customers.csv` data set using Kmeans Clustering model

### Task 5: [Communication ]
- `ADC.ipynb` - analog to digital signal conversion
- `communication.txt` - TinkerCad link for a project of 3 arduinos to send a message from one slave to the other relaying
through the master without any direct connection between them using I2c and Serial communication
the two slaves.
